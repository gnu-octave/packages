 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.

 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
