 The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave 
 toolbox for working with time-frequency analysis and synthesis. 
 It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool. 
 The toolbox provides a large number of linear transforms including
 Gabor and wavelet transforms along with routines for constructing windows 
 (filter prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients
