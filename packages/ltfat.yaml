 The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave
 toolbox for working with time-frequency analysis and synthesis.
 It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool.
 The toolbox provides a large number of linear transforms including
 Gabor and wavelet transforms along with routines for constructing windows
 (filter prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients
