  Functions for queueing networks, discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains
  analysis.  Compute steady-state performance measures for open, closed and
  mixed networks with single or multiple job classes, mean Value Analysis
  (MVA), convolution, and various bounding techniques. Furthermore, several
  transient and steady-state performance measures for Markov chains can be
  computed, such as state occupancy probabilities, mean time to absorption,
  time-averaged sojourn times and so forth.
