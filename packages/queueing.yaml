  The queueing package provides functions for queueing
  networks and Markov chains analysis. This package can be used to
  compute steady-state performance measures for open, closed and mixed
  networks with single or multiple job classes. Mean Value Analysis
  (MVA), convolution, and various bounding techniques are
  implemented. Furthermore, several transient and steady-state
  performance measures for Markov chains can be computed, such as state
  occupancy probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged
  sojourn times and so forth. Discrete- and continuous-time Markov
  chains are supported.
